First Evening looking at Github. 05-Jan-22. 
Heck bent on coding via Python; shooting for the Data Science & Machine Learning down the line.
Interested in expanding AI utilities in Healthcare. 
Many years paid experience in UNIX, LINUX, Bourne, Bash, Sed/Awk abd Expect/TCL in hl7/healthcare.   
 Academic experience in Fortran, Pascal, ANSI C, but not OOP trained (yet). 
 Looking then for coding projects in retirement. Will retire May,2022.
